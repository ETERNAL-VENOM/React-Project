If you wish to run the code locally run the following.

```
yarn
yarn start
visit http://localhost:3000
```

You can also run as an electron app by running `yarn run electron-start`.

Please note that the Spotify API only provides 30 second audio snippets. It may be possible to get the full track by using the [Web Playback SDK](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/).
